# React + Vite

**Dahboard Project Assesment for Isentry**

# This is a project built with react and other depenccies as listed bewlow.

- Axios: To fetch and display data from the given JSONplaceholder API.

- YUP and React-Hook Form: For form validation and handling form submission and error handling.

- React-hot-toast: For notifying user for every CRUD action performed.

- Tailwindcss: For smooth and responsive design

- Tanstack query: For searchin post with key words.

In this mini-dashboard, I fetched data from the API that was provided using axios. I created functions to Create a new post, edit an existing post an updating it and delete a post. I also created 3 modals for editing, posting viewing extra details.
I used tanstack query to query the search so a user can search a post through the search input.

# Improvement

I could improve this dashboard by adding a login form and authentiction. Only authenticated users can have access to certain posts. I could also make the UI better adding charts to show traffic of users checking data in the dashboard.
